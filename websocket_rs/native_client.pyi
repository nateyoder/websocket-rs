"""Native asyncio.Protocol-based WebSocket client (Rust pyclass).

Runs on the asyncio event loop thread — no tokio runtime, no cross-thread
wakeup. Frame codec in Rust with AVX2-vectorised masking. Targets parity with
or better than picows while remaining a pure Python-facing API.

All API-parity items vs the legacy ``async_client`` are implemented; the
legacy module is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.

    - ``headers`` adds arbitrary request headers (reserved names — Host,
      Upgrade, Connection, Sec-WebSocket-* — are filtered automatically).
    - ``subprotocols`` sets ``Sec-WebSocket-Protocol``; the negotiated value
      is then on :attr:`NativeClient.subprotocol`.
    - ``ssl_context`` overrides the default ``ssl.create_default_context()``
      used for ``wss://``. TLS is driven by asyncio so the protocol sees
      decrypted bytes.
    - ``connect_timeout`` defaults to 10 seconds when omitted or ``None`` and
      wraps the full TCP+TLS+handshake sequence in ``asyncio.wait_for``;
      raises ``TimeoutError`` on expiry.
    - ``receive_timeout=None`` (the default) waits indefinitely. A numeric
      value wraps every ``recv()`` / ``async for`` step in
      ``asyncio.wait_for``; the backlog fast-path is not wrapped so already
      queued messages return immediately.
    - ``proxy`` accepts ``socks5://[user:password@]host:port``. Handshake
      runs in ``loop.run_in_executor`` so the event loop stays responsive;
      once the tunnel is up all traffic goes through the native
      zero-copy hot path. ``picows`` does not support proxies.
    - ``compression=True`` negotiates the ``permessage-deflate`` extension
      (RFC 7692) with ``server_no_context_takeover`` +
      ``client_no_context_takeover`` for bounded per-message memory. If the
      server doesn't echo the extension header the client silently falls
      back to sending uncompressed frames. ``picows`` exposes the RSV1 bit
      but does not compress or decompress for you.
    - ``on_message`` switches delivery to a synchronous callback invoked
      from the asyncio Protocol ``data_received`` path. When set, messages
      are NOT queued for :meth:`NativeClient.recv` — the callback receives
      each :class:`WSMessage` directly and must not ``await``. Leave as
      ``None`` for typical async/await usage.
