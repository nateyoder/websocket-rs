# Benchmarks

Comprehensive, reproducible benchmarks against the major Python WebSocket
clients, tested across multiple server architectures. This document
includes **every cell measured**, including the narrow workload where
websocket-rs loses to picows — honest trade-offs over cherry-picked wins.

## Environment

- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, client on core 1, server on core 0 (same CCD for
  L3 sharing, different cores to avoid contention)
- **OS**: WSL2 Ubuntu (Linux 5.15 kernel)
- **Python**: 3.13, uvloop 0.22.1, `gc.disable()` during measurement
- **Transport**: loopback (127.0.0.1), `TCP_NODELAY` on, no TLS
- **Libraries**: websocket-rs (this repo, profile=release), picows 1.18,
  websockets 16.0, aiohttp (latest), websocket-client 1.9

## 1. Request-Response Throughput (picows-parity)

**Methodology**: identical to picows's official benchmark — send, await
response, repeat; count completions in a fixed 10-second window. Higher RPS
is better. Each cell is a fresh process + fresh connection + 50-message
warmup before timing.

Each cell does a 1-second discarded pre-pass (warms Python 3.13 bytecode
specialization, mimalloc heaps, allocator paths, and any first-large-frame
slow paths) before the 10-second timed measurement.

**Payload sizes** (256 B / 8 KB / 100 KB / 1 MB): 1 MB is the upper realistic
bound for a single WebSocket frame in production — Cloudflare hard-caps WS
messages at 1 MB across all plans and most managed WS services
(API Gateway, SignalR) cap at 1 MB or less. Larger payloads only stress
framework limits, not real-world workloads.

| 8 KB  | **15.1k** | 13.4k | 13.2k | 11.8k | 9.6k | 10.1k |
| 100 KB | **10.8k** | 10.3k | 10.5k | 9.4k | 8.1k | 4.5k |
| 1 MB  | 4.0k | **4.2k** | **4.2k** | 3.4k | 3.0k | 509 |

### Against fastwebsockets server (plain TCP)

| Payload | ws-rs sync | ws-rs async | picows | aiohttp | websockets | websocket-client |
|---------|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 B | **15.5k** | 13.1k | 13.6k | 11.9k | 10.0k | 11.5k |
| 8 KB  | **14.5k** | 12.9k | 12.6k | 11.7k | 9.2k | 10.3k |
| 100 KB | **11.3k** | 10.8k | 10.1k | 9.6k | 7.9k | 4.4k |
| 1 MB  | 4.0k | **4.4k** | 4.0k | 3.7k | 3.4k | 528 |

### Against picows server (plain TCP)

| Payload | ws-rs sync | ws-rs async | picows | aiohttp | websockets | websocket-client |
|---------|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 B | **14.1k** | 12.2k | 12.2k | 11.3k | 9.5k | 11.2k |
| 8 KB  | **13.6k** | 12.2k | 11.9k | 10.8k | 8.7k | 9.3k |
| 100 KB | **10.2k** | 9.5k | 9.6k | 8.9k | 7.8k | 4.3k |
| 1 MB  | 3.4k | **3.8k** | 3.3k | 2.8k | 2.6k | 483 |

### TLS (wss://) — tokio-tungstenite server, rustls

Same RR methodology, but every client connects via `wss://` to a
tokio-tungstenite TLS echo server using a self-signed cert from
`tests/certs/`. TLS adds AES-GCM encrypt + decrypt on the data path
(handled by Python's `_ssl` for all clients except the test server,
which uses pure-Rust rustls). 3-run averaged:

| Payload | ws-rs sync | ws-rs async | picows | aiohttp | websockets | websocket-client |
|---------|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 B | **13.2k** | 9.3k | 9.6k | 9.3k | 8.0k | 9.7k |
| 8 KB  | **11.9k** | 8.9k | 8.8k | 8.3k | 7.2k | 8.5k |
| 100 KB | **7.1k** | 5.9k | 6.0k | 5.8k | 5.3k | 3.8k |
| 1 MB  | 1.4k | 1.4k | **1.5k** | 1.4k | 1.4k | 461 |

**TLS overhead**: the same payload runs 25–60% slower under TLS than
plain TCP. TLS dominates the data path at large sizes; the WS framing
library matters less.

**Result summary**:

- **Plain TCP, 12/12 cells**: ws-rs wins or ties everywhere. Sync wins
  256 B–100 KB (no asyncio overhead); async ties picows at 1 MB on
  tokio-tungstenite (4.2k = 4.2k) and wins on the other servers.
- **TLS, 3/4 cells**: ws-rs sync wins 256 B–100 KB — by 18–37% over
  picows, 30–65% over websockets/aiohttp. At 1 MB, picows leads by
  ~7% (1.5k vs 1.4k) — single-RT latency advantage compounds at this
  size; ws-rs ties websockets/aiohttp at 1.4k.
- **vs websocket-client**: 2× at 100 KB, 3× at 1 MB.

Reproduce:
```
python tests/benchmark_picows_parity.py    # plain TCP, 3 servers × 6 clients × 4 sizes
make tls-certs                              # one-time, generates self-signed cert
python tests/benchmark_tls_parity.py        # TLS, 1 server × 6 clients × 4 sizes
```

## 2. Latency Distribution (RR vs pipelined, N=5000)

**Methodology**: measure per-message RTT, report mean / p50 / p99 in ms.
RR is serial (window=1). Pipelined uses window=100 to stress per-message
overhead. Only websocket-rs and picows shown (the only two in the "fast
tier"). `native (on_message)` uses websocket-rs's synchronous callback API
instead of `await ws.recv()` — included to isolate architectural cost from
implementation cost.

### RR mode — tokio-tungstenite server

| Payload | **websocket-rs (await)** | picows |
|---------|---:|---:|
| 512 B | 0.075 / 0.071 / 0.131 | 0.078 / 0.075 / 0.138 |
| 4 KB  | 0.077 / 0.073 / 0.141 | 0.078 / 0.075 / 0.139 |
| 16 KB | 0.082 / 0.077 / 0.149 | 0.077 / 0.071 / 0.147 |
| 64 KB | 0.096 / 0.092 / 0.168 | 0.093 / 0.089 / 0.161 |

**Result**: RR is effectively a tie at all sizes (within 5%).

### Pipelined mode (window=100) — tokio-tungstenite server

| Payload | websocket-rs (await) | websocket-rs (on_message) | picows |
|---------|---:|---:|---:|
| 512 B | 0.201 / 0.191 / 0.355 | **0.180 / 0.181 / 0.251** | 0.229 / 0.221 / 0.332 |
| 4 KB  | **0.241 / 0.221 / 0.516** | 0.240 / 0.243 / 0.388 | 0.294 / 0.293 / 0.426 |
| 16 KB | 0.474 / 0.458 / 0.725 | **0.363 / 0.375 / 0.617** | 0.424 / 0.411 / 0.589 |
| 64 KB | **0.91 / 0.88 / 1.67** | 1.00 / 0.91 / 1.95 | 1.07 / 1.03 / 1.70 |

**Result**: ws-rs wins all sizes. The 64 KB cell improvement came from
two architectural changes (commits `4d42a61` + `2f1e0e4`):
asyncio.BufferedProtocol fast path with a ring-buffer recv_pos cursor.
Together they cut the per-recv `bytes` allocation + per-callback memcpy
+ partial-frame compaction copy that the plain Protocol path incurred.

5-run avg: ws-rs await mean 0.91 ms vs picows 1.07 ms (we win +15%);
p99 1.67 vs 1.70 (we tie). p99 variance also tightened — ws-rs range
1.59–1.83, picows range 1.34–2.43 (we're more consistent).

The `on_message` callback (middle column) is slightly slower at 64 KB
than the `await` API now — its strength was bypassing future overhead,
but with BufferedProtocol the await path is already at the syscall
floor. Use `on_message` only when you specifically need synchronous
delivery semantics, not for raw throughput.

## 3. Memory Footprint (idle connections)

Buffers are allocated lazily — `recv_buf`, `send_buf`, and the framing
`buf` start at zero capacity and grow via `reserve()` on the first send
or receive. Matters for fan-out / notification-listener / IoT-backend
workloads where most connections stay idle for long stretches.

| Metric | Before (eager alloc) | After (lazy alloc, v0.7.0+) |
|--------|---:|---:|
| Per idle connection | ~130 KB | **8.9 KB** |
| 10,000 idle connections | ~1.3 GB | **~90 MB** |
| Warm-path RPS | unchanged | unchanged |

Measurement: open 1,000 uvloop-backed connections against
`ws_echo_server`, no traffic, sample RSS via `getrusage`.

## 4. Compression (permessage-deflate, RFC 7692)

`compression=True` negotiates `permessage-deflate` with
`server/client_no_context_takeover`. Backend: `flate2` (pure-Rust
miniz_oxide). Tested against a Python `websockets` server with deflate
enabled (the built-in `ws_echo_server` does not advertise deflate; the
client silently falls back to uncompressed if the server doesn't).

| Payload (compressible JSON-like) | compression=False | compression=True | delta |
|----------------------------------|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 KB   | 8.8k RPS | 6.4k RPS | −26% |
| 64 KB  | 6.6k RPS | 2.2k RPS | −67% |
| 1 MB   | 2.3k RPS | 172 RPS  | **−93%** |

**On localhost, compression costs more than it saves** — the CPU time
spent compressing exceeds the (zero) bandwidth savings. Compression
becomes beneficial when transmitting over bandwidth-limited links:

| Network | 1 MB plain | 1 MB compressed (~200 KB) | Winner |
|---------|---:|---:|---|
| localhost (≥ 10 GB/s) | ~0 ms wire + 0 CPU | ~0 ms wire + 10 ms CPU | plain |
| LAN (1 Gbps) | ~8 ms wire | ~1.6 ms wire + 10 ms CPU | plain |
| WAN (10 Mbps) | ~800 ms wire | ~160 ms wire + 10 ms CPU | **compressed** |
| Mobile (1 Mbps) | ~8 s wire | ~1.6 s wire + 10 ms CPU | **compressed** |

**Rule of thumb**: enable `compression=True` only when your clients
connect over the public internet and payloads exceed ~1 KB. For same-DC
or low-latency LAN deployments, leave it off.

## 5. When websocket-rs Wins, Ties, or Loses

| Workload | Winner | Gap |
|----------|---|---|
| RR latency, 256 B–4 KB, plain TCP | tied | within 1–3 µs |
| RR latency, 16 KB+, plain TCP | picows | 3–5 µs lower per RTT (Cython cdef vs PyO3) |
| RPS throughput (TCP), 256 B–100 KB | ws-rs sync | +3–14% vs picows |
| RPS throughput (TCP), 1 MB | ws-rs async | tied with picows (4.2k = 4.2k) |
| RPS throughput (TLS), 256 B–100 KB | ws-rs sync | +18–37% vs picows; +22–65% vs websockets/aiohttp |
| RPS throughput (TLS), 1 MB | picows | +7% over ws-rs (1.5k vs 1.4k); ws-rs ties aiohttp/websockets |
| Pipelined latency, 512 B – 64 KB | websocket-rs | mean +14–21% vs picows (best path) |
| vs websockets/aiohttp, plain TCP non-1MB | websocket-rs | +15–65% RPS |
| vs websockets/aiohttp, TLS 1 MB | tied | all four within 7% |
| vs websocket-client, 100 KB | websocket-rs | 2.4× RPS |
| vs websocket-client, 1 MB plain TCP | websocket-rs | 8× RPS |
| Memory per idle conn | websocket-rs | 9 KB vs picows ~50 KB (5–6× lighter) |
| Over real WAN (Postman Echo wss://) | all clients ~= | <1% (network RT dominates) |

## 6. Reproduce

```bash
# Build the Rust extension and neutral echo servers
make build
cargo build --release --bin ws_echo_server --bin ws_echo_fastws

# Main benchmark (RR, 4 sizes, 3 servers, 6 clients, ~12 min)
python tests/benchmark_picows_parity.py

# Latency matrix (RR + pipelined, 4 sizes, 3 clients, ~5 min)
python tests/benchmark_three_servers.py

# Syscall / flame-graph diagnostic (requires perf + root)
# See tests/perf_pipelined_64k.py for the harness
```

All benchmark scripts pin cores 0/1, use uvloop, disable GC during timing,
and warm up before measuring. Numbers fluctuate by ~3% run-to-run; figures
above are from a single representative run after the system stabilized.

## 7. Comparing two builds (`tests/bench_ab.py`)

The scripts above answer "how does websocket-rs compare to other clients". They
do not answer "did my change help", and that ~3% run-to-run fluctuation is
exactly the size of the effects worth merging. One change here measured +8.02%,
+4.62%, +2.40%, +2.20% and +2.69% across five sessions on the same machine;
picking any single number would have put a wrong figure in the CHANGELOG.

`tests/bench_ab.py` measures a change instead of a competitor. Every round runs
both builds back to back against the same server process, alternating which one
goes first, and reports the median of the per-round ratios with a bootstrap
confidence interval. Pairing cancels the drift; the interval reports what is
left.

```bash
make bench-servers                      # plain + TLS echo servers

cargo build --release                   # baseline, e.g. from main
cp target/release/libwebsocket_rs.so /tmp/base.so
# ... apply your change ...
cargo build --release
cp target/release/libwebsocket_rs.so /tmp/cand.so

python tests/bench_ab.py -b /tmp/base.so -c /tmp/cand.so
python tests/bench_ab.py -b /tmp/base.so -c /tmp/cand.so --sizes 1048576 --rounds 21
python tests/bench_ab.py -b /tmp/base.so -c /tmp/cand.so --transport tls
```

`--transport tls` is a genuinely different code path, not just a slower one:
`wss://` has no raw fd, so every send goes through `build_merged_frame` rather
than the raw-fd fast path. A change that only touches one of the two needs
measuring on both.

Each cell runs in its own interpreter with its own staged copy of the package,
so the two builds never share a process and the working tree's own `.so` is left
alone while a comparison runs.

Reading the output: the repo gates performance claims at +2% on the median.
Quote the interval and the round count next to it. An interval straddling zero
means the run did not resolve the effect, which is a reason to add rounds, not a
reason to report zero. Sanity check the harness on any host by passing the same
`.so` as both arms; it should land on zero with an interval that contains it.
